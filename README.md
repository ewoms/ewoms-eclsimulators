The ewoms-eclsimulators module
==============================

This eWoms module provides ready-to-use simulators that can substitute
the commercial ECLIPSE 100 and -- to a much lesser extend -- ECLIPSE 300
reservoir simulators. The simulators implemented by this module accept
input in the same format and produce compatible output as above
simulators.

Installation
============

Like all eWoms modules, ewoms-eclsimulators uses the DUNE build system to
handle the building and installation process. It is thus supposed to
be build using the `dunecontrol` utility. Please confer to the [INSTALL](https://github.com/ewoms/ewoms-common/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file located in the ewoms-common module for detailed build
instructions.
